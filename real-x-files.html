Since The X-Files‘ early seasons were filmed in Vancouver, the writers and cast were very aware of the case, and the characters of Lucy and Amy were certainly influenced by Klaas.</p><h2>Nisei/731</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50377 alt="Real X Files Unit 731" width=750 height=593 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/real-xfiles-unit731.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-50377 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p><p>This two-part episode arc was based on the real Unit 731 of the Japanese Imperial Army. In the mid-90s, many were learning about the atrocities the unit committed during World War II, and Carter felt that the stories of human experimentation during wartime almost constituted a real-life X-File. Unit 731 was not tried for war crimes despite the fact that they subjected humans to biochemical warfare agents, medical torture and rape and forced pregnancies and vivisection.</p><p>Many countries, including the United States, agreed not to try the researchers at Unit 731 in exchange for the information and data gathered from their studies, much of which went directly into the development of the U.S. biological warfare program.</p><h2>Folie à Deux</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50372 alt="Real X Files Folie" width=750 height=435 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/real-xfiles-folieadeux.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-50372 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikia</a></p><p>This episode took its title and concept from a real-life psychological phenomenon where two people share a single delusion. The phrase is french for “madness shared by two.” Written by veteran X-Files writer Vince Gilligan (of Breaking Bad fame), this episode was inspired by the terrifying concept of seeing monsters that no one else appears to be able to see.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscClZLFllp65pr%2BObA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-wittenberg.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dave Wittenberg</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-japanese-house-dionne-new-song-justin-vernon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Song With Bon Iver Frontman Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chinese-american-author.html>Chinese-American Author Fresher Post</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leilani-green-2.html>Leilani Green Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mattie-westbrouck.html>Mattie Westbrouck Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cameron-carter.html>Cameron Carter - Bio, Single, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-long.html>Eddie Long</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.
