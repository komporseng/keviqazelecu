into the air as he was trying to help a young girl climb onto it.</p><p>The terrifying incident happened about 4:30 p.m. Sunday during the 54th annual Groves Pecan Festival in Groves, a city about 90 miles east of Houston, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KMBT reported</a>.</p><p>The operator of “The Bullet” was helping Juliana Bernal get into the ride when a sudden gust of wind launched the car into the air.</p><p>Rather than letting go, the man held onto the door and tried to shut it to protect Juliana as his legs dangled underneath.</p><p>The compartment turned 180 degrees and stalled 30 feet off the ground to the shock of carnival-goers who screamed while watching the death-defying incident unfold, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to KFDM</a>, which posted the video.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A Texas amusement park operator has been hailed as a hero after he hung onto a ride and fought to protect a

other compartments on the ground level during the emergency.</p><p>The unidentified operator has been hailed as a hero after he managed to shut the door.</p><p>He was eventually rescued along with the girl.</p><p>Juliana’s mom, Caress Muraira, described how a day of fun turned into a near-disaster.</p><p>“We just wanted to have a little fun, you know, a family day. We went and got the wristbands. That was the first ride she wanted to do,” Muraira told KMBT about her daughter.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Juliana Bernal, 12, was not hurt during the ordeal. <span class=credit>Courtesy family</span></figure><p>“It started going slow at first and he was trying to stop it, her door wasn’t closed. So I started freaking out, as he went to close the door he just kind of flew up with it,” she said.</p><p>“My daughter was up there and talking to him. Saying, ‘Please hang on! Don’t fall,’” Muraira continued.</p><p>Groves City Marshal Norman Reynolds, who happened to be nearby and also saw the incident, said the ride operator was shaken up after the ordeal.</p><p>“My daughter did say she saw blood on his fingers from where he was holding on, that’s why she was worried, Muraira said. “I just wanted to make sure he was OK … They took him and that’s when we weren’t able to contact him. So hopefully she gets to say thank you.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The man hangs on for dear life from “The Bullet.” <span class=credit>Storyful / Eric McCauley</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The ride at the Groves Pecan Festival was shut down after the incident. <span class=credit>Groves Pecan Festival</span></figure><p>The operator was not badly hurt and Juliana emerged unscathed.</p><p>A spokesperson for the local Chamber of Commerce, which &nbsp;festival organized the festival, told USA Today that the ride operator was fine.</p><p>“Felt like the longest time of my life, you know? I have seen this stuff happen on social media before. You never think it’s going to happen to you and then it happened,” Muraira told KMBT.</p><p>“I am just so happy my daughter was saved, and am so grateful to that man,” she added.</p><p>“The Bullet” was shut down for the rest of the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmanFfq7alsc5mqqGnp6h6ornUrJymnZ6perGt0aRkqKiVp661u9Fmm5qml6G2r7OMn6mopV2ntqWxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-james-hardens-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is James Harden's Net Worth in 2024?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pierre-luc-gagnon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pierre-Luc Gagnon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chinese-american-author.html>Chinese-American Author Fresher Post</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leilani-green-2.html>Leilani Green Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mattie-westbrouck.html>Mattie Westbrouck Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cameron-carter.html>Cameron Carter - Bio, Single, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-long.html>Eddie Long</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.
