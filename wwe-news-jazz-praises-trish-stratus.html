Trish Stratus established herself to be one of the most popular female superstars of WWE. Stratus was involved in sexually themed storylines early in her career with Vince McMahon, at one point (as a part of the Storyline) McMahon humiliating her in a disgraceful way by forcing her to strip down and bark like a dog. The Storyline then ended at WrestleMania 17, when Stratus slapped Vince at the event. She also acted as a manager to the then heel Val Venus during her early years in WWE.</p><p>Thereafter, Trish Stratus began competing as a singles wrestler and won her first WWF Women’s Championship in 2001 at the Survivor Series. Trish Stratus competed in the Six Pack Challenge and defeated Ivory, Jazz, Jacqueline, Molly Holly and Lita to win the vacant Women’s Championship at the event. She held the title for 76 days before losing it to Jazz on an edition of RAW. Thereafter she constantly chased the Women’s title and the Championship revolved around her. She has the most number of reigns, 7 for the championship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>ALSO READ: <a href=# data-type=post data-id=637291>REVEALED : Huge update over the future plans of Seth Rollins and Riddle especially after WWE announced an injury to the latter henceforth scrapping their Summerslam match</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong><strong>Jazz had defeated Trish Stratus at Backlash 2003</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CC_Express_20220728_2255480-1024x576.jpg><p>In 2003, after winning the Women’s Championship for the fourth time at WrestleMania 19, Trish Stratus was slated to defend her title against Jazz at Backlash 2003. As a part of the storyline, Trish was not recommended to wrestle because of his broken ribs, but Eric Bischoff, the general manager of Raw, persuaded the doctors to allow her to compete at Backlash. Both Stratus and Jazz engaged in a back-and-forth wrestling contest.</p><p>Trish then gained dominance by applying a Stratusfaction to Jazz. When the referee pinned Trish’s attempt, Theodore long who was by Jazz’s side flung his sneaker at her head, thereby causing the pin to break. Trish then attempted to do a springboard sunset flip on Jazz at the conclusion of the match, but Jazz blocked it by sitting on her and holding the middle rope to win the championship.</p><p>Jazz appeared on the latest episode of Sportskeeda UnSKripted and discussed about her Storyline with Trish Stratus and showered praise the seven time Women’s Champion. Jazz said that Trish was the face of WWE and that really helped her heel persona. Jazz stated that they both understood the heel and babyface assignment very well and decided to give their best out there.</p><p>“One thing that helped me really get over as a heel because me being in a program with Trish, Trish was just so loved, she was the face of WWE. So, it really made my job easy. We both understood the assignment, you know. Good heel, good babyface, let’s go out there and kill it.”</p><p>After defeated by Jazz at Backlash, Trish thereafter won the title after a year in June 2004 by defeating Victoria at Bad Blood.</p><p>ALSO READ: <a href=# data-type=post data-id=638219>“I am very impressed by him” Dolph Ziggler acknowledges Roman Reigns for his record-shattering title reign</a></p><p>ALSO READ: <a href=# data-type=post data-id=637877>“Let’s collab” Bianca Belair welcomes Cardi B, Nicki Minaj and Meg Thee Stallion to WWE</a></p><p>Do follow us on: <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://news.google.com/s/CBIwhuWAo00?sceid=IN:en&sceid=IN:en&r=11&oc=1">Google News</a> |<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.facebook.com/firstsportz/> Facebook </a>| <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://instagram.com/firstsportz?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">Instagram </a>| <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://twitter.com/SportzFirst?t=cjJZ27QpbYUgobJkYsBKZQ&s=08">Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqaVrMButsCzsWaoopa2tLHSZquroaOderTA0Zqrrqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./loco-escrito-mi-culpa-lyrics-english-translation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Loco Escrito Mi Culpa Lyrics English Translation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./garrett-watts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Garrett Watts Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Facts, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chinese-american-author.html>Chinese-American Author Fresher Post</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leilani-green-2.html>Leilani Green Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mattie-westbrouck.html>Mattie Westbrouck Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cameron-carter.html>Cameron Carter - Bio, Single, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eddie-long.html>Eddie Long</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.
