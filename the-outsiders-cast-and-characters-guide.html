The coming-of-age story directed by <a href=#><strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong></a> (<strong>The Godfather</strong>) was released in March 1983. It featured an ensemble cast of up-and-coming talent who became Hollywood's biggest stars. Based on the book by <strong>S.E. Hinton</strong>, the film was a critical and financial success. It has earned a cult following thanks to its impressive ensemble, Coppola’s direction, and the film's source material was a fixture in many high school curriculums for years.
