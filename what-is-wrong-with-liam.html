Well at least he didn’t faint.</p><p><span class=post-likes>15 Likes</span></p><p>And this is the issue liam just walks away and always ends up kissing steffy or bedding her. Like is he really did love hope he would if confronted the situation right then and there. But he does what he do best and run to steffy, i bet he knew or saw her in the area. And steffy saying he did not deserve it was bs to me. The many times liam flip flopped between them and cheated on both of them while married. This was def karma catching up to him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/e274bd/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> LULIX:<p>Kissing a married woman who husband just gave him a huge pep talk.</p><p>But why didn’t Steffy push him away immediately?

I’m sure she will be paired but the actress is pregnant and going on maternity leave soon.</p><p>They better not use this as a way to write her out for a while.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I figured that Bell would use JMW’s maternity way to his advantage to throw Steffy under the bus somehow. He needs to get his digs in on those he despises.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Maybe Liam doesn’t stay and address the issue because, on some subconscious level, he is looking for the exit.</p><p>When Sinn was shot and Finn thought to be dead, Liam immediately started to plan to insert himself in the role of father to Hayes. He did this all on his own because Steffy was still either unresponsive or barely conscious when Liam’s mental gears started turning. Hope was assuring Liam that all of the family could make sure Hayes was loved and secure. Liam talked on as though Hope hadn’t made that valid suggestion. I think he basically told Hope that handling that situation was his job. I translated that as Hope beng left with half a spouse.</p><p>Even further back in time, during the Statt marriage, Steffy made it clear she was not leaving Wyatt and planned to try to make the Statt marriage work. Liam told Steffy that he would wait and went on to advise her to go ahead and honor her marriage, but sooner or later a serious mess up would happen and a door made available for her to exit the marriage. He told Steffy that when she saw the door she should walk through it because he would be right there on the other side of it waiting for her.</p><p>Since this is how Liam thinks or is capable of thinking…is it possible, even subconsciously, that he is doing that now? I mean, seriously, Liam committed adultery in this same marriage…but can’t forgive the same wife who forgave him for a kiss with another man? Makes no sense.</p><p>That Lope marriage has serious issues. IMO, Liam doesn’t beeline it to Steffy just because she is his security blanket that he only needs and wants when he is hurt and I seriously doubt that either Finn or Hope is going to be silly enough to believe that. LOL!</p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>Liam doesn’t deserve a woman like Steffy, and I hope she tells Finn about the kiss. I want to see Finn rip Liam a new one. Steffy should rip him a new one too for always turning to her for ‘comfort’ when things are messed up with Hope. He had multiple chances with Steffy, but he chose Hope, and he chose wrong.</p><p>Liam always had so much adventure, fun and excitement with Steffy. I can’t remember a single ‘fun’ moment that he’s had with Hope.</p><p>He really did choose wrong.</p><p><span class=post-likes>11 Likes</span></p><p>No, Liam certainly does not deserve another chance at Steffy. But, IMO, Steam is just a tad more involved than “comfort.”.</p><p>This is the second time Liam has declared that he made a mistake and he’s right. He made a huge mistake; but, Steffy deserves love and security with a man who appreciates her for the beautiful gem that she is. IMO, that man is Finn.</p><p>If Liam has an ounce of decency, he will apologize to Steffy on Monday and then go home and work on restoring his marriage rather than playing any role in putting Steffy’s marriage in harm’s way.</p><p>Liam looked a little stunned after he kissed Steffy. Maybe his intentions are good despite his stupidity. They made a big deal of making it clear that they were dropping these couples into the city of eternal love. Maybe that Steam kiss was just them reminding us of who Liam’s eternal love is in their minds…and they will move on from here.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I hope on Monday’s episode, they reshow Liam kissing Steffy and then Steffy punches Liam in the face. Of course it won’t happen but it would be good.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>If it comes out that Liam kissed Steffy, I hope Taylor rips him and Ridge a new one. This whole back and forth (Taylor-Ridge-Brooke) has to have messed up Steffy and Thomas. Their relationship behaviors are proof of that and Steffy’s dysfunctional relationship with Liam.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>Ugh I despise Liam. When he kissed steffy it looked so gross. Sreffy is too much woman for Liam now and he is out of her league. He looked like a little boy under her. They need to bring back Ivy or some other woman for him who is more his speed.</p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>He sure doesn’t deserve Steffy. She is too much woman for him. Liam is so immature, whiny and childish. I don’t blame hope for fantasizing about and wanting Thomas.</p><p><span class=post-likes>8 Likes</span></p><p>The back and forth with Brooke-Ridge-Taylor also messed up Hope. Oddly enough, Thomas seems to have come out of this a one-woman man. Probably didn’t want to become Ridge. Meanwhile, Steffy and Hope have been OK with a man “also loving” another woman as long as they hold sole custody of said waffling man. They became their mothers.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I would like to see Taylor become Mama Bear and go to town on the wafflers. Probably won’t happen since Bell had reduced her to a giggly middle school girl. Pizz poor writing. All to prop his favorites.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>When Bell had Taylor groveling to Brooke for forgiveness, I was disgusted by that. That was the final nail in Taylor’s character. She should not have been remorseful about shooting Bill. If I thought Bill assaulted my daughter, more horrible things would have been done to him. Shooting is too easy.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I think Taylor speaks her mind on Bridge and worries about the future next week. My guess is she’s less than thrilled about her children being kissed by the Spencers. She needs to kick that Bridge mess to the curb and be done with it. Taylor is better than that and needs to be returned to the beautiful class act that she is.</p><p>She will also have a confrontation with Brooke. I don’t see the point of it if it concerns Ridge. But, if Taylor is in Mama Bear mode in defense of Thomas and Steffy, I am all in for it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>So when Liam gets back to LA, will he be going to everyone (I mean everyone) telling them about Thomas/Hope, how he was wrong, and what he did with Steffy? Will he reveal that Thomas was actually the one who did not initiate the kiss and that he was actually the one who pulled a fast one in addition to Hope? Something tells me no.</p><p>When he thought Thomas was the villain, he was happy to tell everyone near him. I guess he never imagined he or his wife could be the villains of this story.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Thomas once told Liam that Steph is Liam’s Brooke although I disagree and I’m glad she’s staying with Finn I love them together</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Yes he is. Even if they made Finn out to be an evil axe murderer or something, I still wouldn’t want Steffy with Liam. He is such a wuss.
