Over the years, people have been wondering who is Mr. Krabs' wife and if she died. Find out everything about the show here.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-mr-krabs>What Happened To Mr. Krabs Wife?</h2><p>The identity of Mr. Krabs Wife is the biggest question among the fans of the show as nobody knows what exactly happened to her.</p><p>Over the years, in the last 10 seasons, viewers have met with many characters from the underwater city Bikini Bottom. The show watchers are aware of them but the mysterious questions stills hold the question of who is Mr. Krab's wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Krabs has his own backstory and mysterious family life. Pearl Krabs is Mr. Krab's teenage daughter who lives off her father's money.

The SpongeBob SquarePants Trivia Book did share some lights on Mrs. Krabs, however, the book still doesn't mention her anywhere on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=how-did-mrs-krabs-wife-di>How Did Mrs. Krabs Wife Die?</h2><p>The Squarepants book refers that Pearl's mother as also a whale. But it is still not clear if she has died or has been divorced. One thing for sure is she is out of the family picture on the show for all 10 seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Hillenburg was strongly against revealing the identity of Pearl's mother on the show. The makers of the show want to keep her identity under the warp till the end. This adds lots of mystery to the show as well as to the life of Krab and Pearl.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#UnlikelyStripClubNames</a> Mrs. Krab's Pearl Necklace <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jEH1O8WrXt</a></p>— Dr. Bigz (@phillywitchdr) <a href=#>August 2, 2016</a><h2 id=whats-wrong-with-mr-krabs>What's Wrong With Mr. Krabs Wife?</h2><p>The Krabs Family has made a lot of theories about Mr.s Krabs while she still is out of the picture and It is not sure what's wrong with her.&nbsp;</p><p>The makers of the show are willingly keeping her identity out of the show.
