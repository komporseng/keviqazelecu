She was last seen on the balcony of her family’s stateroom around 5:30 a.m. By 6:00, she was gone.</p><p>Wherever she went, she took her room key and her cigarettes with her —&nbsp;but she left her sandals behind.</p><p>Bradley’s family begged the ship’s crew not to let anyone disembark at the next port, Curaçao, until they’d carried out a thorough search, but they were ignored. If someone had kidnapped Bradley — as her parents believe —&nbsp;they had ample opportunity to sneak her off the boat and into a foreign country, never to be seen again.</p><p>In the decades since Bradley’s disappearance, numerous theories have emerged about her fate. Some believe she simply fell overboard and was lost in the waves. Others suggest she may have jumped. But Bradley’s parents say she had a new apartment and a new job waiting for her back in her home state of Virginia, not to mention her beloved bulldog, Daisy.</p><p>According to Bradley’s family, something more sinister happened. And they say the alleged sightings of Bradley that have been reported over the past 25 years prove it.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-449027 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/potentially-amy-lynn-bradley.jpg alt="Purported Photo Of Amy Lynn Bradley" width=900 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-449027 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>The photo that Amy Lynn Bradley’s parents received via email seven years after her disappearance.</span></p><p>Five months after Bradley disappeared, two Canadian tourists spotted a woman who matched her description on a beach in Curaçao. The woman even had the same tattoos as Bradley, including a lizard on her navel and the Tasmanian Devil spinning a basketball on her shoulder. However, they reportedly didn’t know she was a missing person until they saw her case on a television show after the fact.</p><p>The following year, a Navy officer claimed that he saw a woman in a Curaçao brothel who said her name was Amy Lynn Bradley and begged for his help. However, he never reported the incident because he didn’t want to get in trouble.</p><p>Then, in 2005, Bradley’s parents received an email with a photo of a woman who appeared to be their daughter lying on a bed in her underwear. These incidents have only strengthened the family’s suspicions that Bradley was kidnapped and trafficked into sex slavery.</p><p>Today, the case of Amy Lynn Bradley remains one of the most bizarre unsolved mysteries in modern history. Unfortunately, investigators are no closer to solving her disappearance than they were nearly three decades ago — so her fate may remain a mystery forever.</p><p>Learn more about the circumstances behind <a href=#>Amy Lynn Bradley’s disappearance</a> and the theories that emerged in the aftermath.</p><p class=.post-content>Learn more about the <a href=#>music</a> used in our podcast.
