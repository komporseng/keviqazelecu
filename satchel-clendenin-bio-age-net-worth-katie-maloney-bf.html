Who is he? What does he do for a living? Who are his family members?</p><p>These are some of the questions we’ll be tackling in this article here. So, keep scrolling down to learn more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Satchel Clendenin, Katie Maloney BF</strong></h3><p>In the 19 April 2023 episode, Katie Maloney took her 25-year-old beau Satchel Clendenin to Lala Kent’s birthday dinner, claiming that he was named after baseball player Satchel Paige. “Satchel is a very sweet guy that I met one night out with my girlfriends,” Katie said. “I was like, ‘Oh here’s this young guy, this will be fun.’ I didn’t really anticipate to keep hanging out with him, I came for the D and I stayed for the conversation.”</p><p>Katie and Satchel reportedly met when she was out one night with her girlfriends. She didn’t expect to keep hanging out with him after their initial meeting.</p><p>Katie initially said she kept her budding relationship with Satchel under wraps out of respect for her ex-husband, but after Schwartz decided to disregard Katie’s request to avoid dating anyone in their common buddy group, everything changed. Even in a confessional, she made note of the stark differences between the two guys.</p><p>“He’s very sweet and shows me affection, and it’s just a nice change,” Katie added. “And let’s just say I won’t be complaining to anyone about how his dick doesn’t work.”</p><p>The cast members of Katie have already met Satchel who had mixed reactions from different casts. Lala said that Katie was “beaming” while cozying up to Satchel, but Scheana was a bit more critical. “It’s weird seeing Katie with this mactor, shaggy dog-looking motherf*cker,” Scheana said in a confessional. “I mean, he looks like he just got groomed at Vanderpump Dogs.”</p><p>But Katie hesitated to introduce Satchel as her boyfriend. In February, Katie announced that she was “single”&nbsp;on her Instagram Story, even laughing off&nbsp;dating rumors&nbsp;with newly engaged&nbsp;Lukas Gage, and told Andy Cohen on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;that she has a type while dating. “They’re all young; I like it,” Katie said. “The young ones are kind of where it’s at.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Bravo,&nbsp;Katie had teased that she was having&nbsp;a&nbsp;“casual thing” with a younger guy in the fall of 2022. This man turned out to be Satchel. However, they are no longer together. In December 2022, Katie confirmed that she was single.</p><h3><strong>Satchel Clendenin Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Satchel Clendenin is 26 years old.
