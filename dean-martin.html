It did not go well, and the show’s owner told them to improve their act. They chose to be harsher in their performances, adding songs, slapstick, and classic vaudeville humor. The audience adored the “wild” show, and the couple received a lot of praise for their spontaneous acts. The act eventually landed them a series of well-paying engagements across the Eastern seaboard, as well as a run at the Copacabana in New York.</p><h4>More Details</h4><p>Dean Martin also appeared in several short and feature films.
