He’s tried on dozens of hairstyles over the years, from a quiff to an undercut. Over the years, he has experimented with a variety of styles and looks.</p><p>However, out of all the hairstyles he’s had, the man bun appears to be his favorite, and he can be seen wearing it in his most recent video and posts. Jacksepticeye not only likes the look on himself, but he also encourages others to do so. In 2017, he responded to a tweet from popular twitch streamer MoistCr1TiKaL by suggesting that MoistCr1TiKaL grow out his hair and wear it in a man bun or ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/talent_jacksepticeye_headshot2-1.jpg><p>In April 2020, Jacksepticeye did a throwback post, posting several photos of himself wearing a denim jacket and pants and displaying his man bun. “Might **** around and bring this look back,” he wrote alongside the photos, implying that he might go back to that hairstyle.</p><p>The An1me Man, an anime YouTuber, asked if the two could be man bun bros, to which Jacksepticeye replied, “Absolutely!!!” Absolutely!!! In August 2020, Jack also complimented voice actor and twitch streamer Bryan Dechart when the latter showed off his man bun.</p><p>The YouTuber seemed pleased with Dechart’s hairstyle choice, as he, too, was wearing a man bun, and he expressed his delight by writing, “Man bun buds!”</p><h2>For a Charity, Jacksepticeye dyed his hair green</h2><p>While Jacksepticeye enjoys wearing a man bun, his fans seem to prefer his hair dyed green. His look has become so popular among his fans that he has been dubbed “green PewDiePie” in memes.</p><p>While Jacksepticeye is primarily known for his gaming content, he also does a lot of charity streams. Jacksepticeye hosted a #thankmas charity stream in December 2020, with a goal of raising $500,000.</p><p>If the goal was achieved, he promised to dye his hair green on stream. He kept his promise after the stream raised half a million dollars in just 2 hours and 19 minutes. Jacksepticeye and his viewers had raised over $4 million by the end of the stream.</p><p>In June 2019, he did a similar stream with the goal of raising $100,000 for charity. He’d also achieved the target amount back then, and he’d returned his signature look afterward.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jacksepticeye</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Man's Bun</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiwqK2kqq%2BmvoyjmJyjo5q9tbXCnrCeZaOasq6%2FjKyrsqSZqLVuw8itn2agmah6rq3NZpmupl2drqq%2B0q2wpZ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sydney-mesher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Sydney Mesher, Dancer for Rockette is Dating Someone Secretly?
