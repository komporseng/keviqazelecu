He was born on <strong>August 31, 2016</strong>, in Los Angeles, California, and his zodiac sign is Virgo.</p><p>Asghedom has already garnered a lot of popularity, especially among his father's fans. His mother, London, who also has a big fan following herself, has only contributed more to her son's fame and success.</p><h2>Death Of Asghedom's Father, Nipsey Hussle</h2><p>Asghedom is both fortunate and unfortunate at the same time. He is lucky because of he is born to famous parents and unfortunate at the same time because he will never get to see his father. Asghedom was only <strong>two years old</strong> when his father, Nipsey Hussle, was killed.</p><p>Asghedom's&nbsp;father, Nipsey, died from a gunshot which is also one of the most common reasons for death among American hip-hop artists. It's sad to see someone getting killed, especially when they are still young and have a lot of life ahead of them. He was only <strong>33 years old</strong> at the time of his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/56219772_121539565685777_935960700068203249_n%20(1)-1671607517778.jpg><p><strong>Eric R. Holder</strong>, the man responsible for Asghedom's father's death, was found guilty three years after the incident occurred. The incident happened on <strong>March 31, 2019</strong>, in South Los Angeles, near his clothing store.</p><p>Asghedom's mother, London, has spoken to the media regarding her boyfriend's death since. She talked to the <i>E! News</i> about her healing process and how she has moved on with her life. In the same interview, she also talked about carrying his legacy forward. She said:</p><p>In my life now, anything that I do I want it to have purpose and I want it to be intentional. I hope that he would be proud that I am taking a chance on myself. Any and everything I do will always be attributed to him in my heart.</p><h2>Nipsey Hussle Previous Relationship With Tanisha Foster</h2><p><i>Let the Darkness In</i> rapper Nipsey's relationship with Asghedom's mother is well-known to the public, but that wasn't the first time he found love. He was involved with Tanisha Foster. And it wasn't just a fling because their relationship lasted for years.&nbsp;</p><p>The two were together from <strong>July 2003</strong> till <strong>August 2011</strong>. Tanisha usually stays away from the media, but her custody battle with the <i>Racks In The Middle </i>rapper for their daughter was the talk of the town when it happened.</p><h2>How Rich Is Asghedom's&nbsp;Mother?</h2><p>Kross Ermias Asghedom is still very young to work and make a living. But his mother is an established actress, which has also led to her making a lot of money from it. <i>So, what is her net worth?</i></p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Lauren London's</a> estimated net worth is around <strong>$8 Million</strong>. She amassed this wealth from her movie and modeling work. She has signed numerous fashion deals, one of them being with <strong>US Puma</strong>. Her LA Love Story collection has been an enormous success and has only aided her in improving her net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/316095337_203756135358841_134332091561319767_n%20(1)-1671608696944.jpg><p>Asghedom's&nbsp;father, Nipsey Hussle, may be no longer with him, but while he was alive and healthy, he made a lot of money thanks to his successful rap career. His net worth was <strong>$8 Million</strong>. Besides music, he was also the owner of a strip mall in South Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Asghedom's&nbsp;Parent Relationship&nbsp;</h2><p>Kross Ermias Asghedom's parent's relationship was adored by many. They looked good together, and it's sad to learn how that relationship ended. <i>So, how did it start between the two?</i></p><p>Reports suggest that the ex-couple Nipsey Hussle and Lauren London met in Los Angeles. The pair first started seeing each other in <strong>2013</strong>. However, their relationship wasn't all rosy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/Screenshot_20221221_131944%20(1)-1671608221915.jpg><p>Lauren and Nipsey were rumored to have been engaged as there were engagement photos of them. Later it was clarified that the pictures were only for the GQ photoshoot.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Essence</i></a> reports that these two broke up for a while in <strong>November 2017</strong> before patching things up. And the <i>Always and 4Ever</i> actress has acknowledged that their relationship wasn't always happy.</p><p>London talked about it while sitting down to speak in <i>Angie Martinez's IRL Podcast</i>. She had this to say about her relationship with the <i>Grinding All My Life</i> rapper:</p><p>We had pure love&nbsp;but that does not mean that our egos did not get attached in aspects of our relationship. But we definitely had pure love, always good intention.</p><h2>Asghedom's Mother Was Previously Engaged To Lil Wayne</h2><p>It's not just Kross Ermias Asghedom's father with a bit of a relationship history but also his mother. It looks like <i>Madea's Big Happy Family</i> actress, Lauren London, had a thing for hip-hop artists. Before Nipsey, she was in a relationship with the famous rapper <strong>Lil Wayne</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>London's relationship with the <i>How To Love</i> rapper Wayne went through many ups and downs, lasting from <strong>1998</strong> to <strong>2009</strong>. The childhood sweethearts even shared a son together, <a href=#><strong>Cameron Carter.</strong></a> They went through many breakups and patch-ups during this time. But it looks like she doesn't have any grudge against him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/Screenshot_20221221_132458%20(1)-1671608468042.jpg><p><i>Nicki Swift</i> mentioned the London interview with <i>KathleenCross.com</i>, where she spoke about her time with the lollipop rapper. She said:</p><p>We were in a relationship that didn't make it. We tried more than once to revive it, and we were engaged briefly years ago, but we eventually parted ways. My son's father is an intelligent, loving, and lovable person who will always be a dear friend. That is all.</p><h2>Has Two Half Siblings</h2><p>Kross Ermias Asghedom is the only child of Hussle and London. But he isn't the only child of his parents. Both his mother and late father have a child from their previous relationship.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Last Time That I Checc'd</i> rapper Nipsey Hussle has a daughter named <strong>Emani Asghedom</strong> from his time with Tanisha Foster. Emani's parents famously fought for her custody a while back.</p><p>Asghedom's&nbsp;mother, Lauren London, knew what it was like to raise a son before Asghedom since she was already a mother to a son named <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kameron Carter</a>. Kameron's father is Lil Wayne. He was born in <strong>2009</strong>.</p><h2>Asghedom's&nbsp;Mother Controversy With Kodak Black Backlash</h2><p>Rapper Kodak Black is a popular name in the hip-hop industry and has had a lot of hits. But besides the music, he is also known for the things he says, which don't go down well most of the time. In one such instance, his flirting with <i>The Perfect Match </i>actress London didn't go well among people.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>This happened not long after the death of Asghedom's father. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lisa Respers France for <i>CNN</i></a> reports that while she was still in pain seeing Hussle's death, Black, on his Insta live, tried to ask London out. He said:</p><p>I’ll give her a whole year. She might need a whole year to be crying and s*** for him.</p><p>No surprise that it didn't go well with the people. Everyone came in support of London and criticized Black for it. The <i>Tunnel Vision</i> rapper followed with an apology video for London, but as expected, many people didn't buy his apology.</p><p><i><strong>Are you interested in reading more exciting celebrity bios like this?
