He put his name in the transfer portal last year, thinking a bigger school might increase his draft status, but he said his commitment to Florida A&M and <a href=#>HBCU football</a> ultimately wasn’t something he could walk away from.</p><p>Land, a 6-foot-3, 236-pound outside linebacker/edge rusher, is considered the consensus <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">top HBCU prospect in this week’s draft</a>. He was named the 2021 Buck Buchanan Award recipient, given to the best defensive player in the FCS. He also was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">named an FCS All-American</a> in December.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>2023 NFL Draft Player Rankings: Dane Brugler breaks down the top 300 prospects</p></a><p>Football at HBCUs has received more attention in recent years. Deion Sanders’ three-year coaching stint at Jackson State brought mainstream media to the competition. But that hasn’t necessarily translated into more opportunities for aspiring <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> players. Only four HBCU players were drafted last year. None was selected in 2021.</p><p>Land was one of two HBCU standouts invited to this year’s NFL Scouting Combine, the other being Arkansas-Pine Bluff offensive lineman Mark Evans II. Land wants his success to inspire others to play for HBCUs. Most importantly, he wants athletes to know that NFL dreams can come from outside FBS programs.</p><p>“You can make any of your goals come true from an HBCU,” Land said. “There was a point when Black football players couldn’t play at Alabama or Georgia. So, it’s an honor to say I played at FAMU, and we should be able to build up HBCUs.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/25114642/GettyImages-1478257469-scaled-e1682448974258.jpg alt width=2560 height=1708 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Isaiah Land is considered the top-ranked HBCU prospect in the 2023 NFL Draft. (Don Juan Moore / Getty Images)</span><p>Land is <a href=# rel=noopener>projected as a seventh-round selection</a> in this week’s draft, writes The Athletic’s Dane Brugler. A year ago, Land questioned whether being at an HBCU was his best route to the NFL. He had a monster season in 2021, which included 43 tackles and a national-best 19 sacks in leading the Rattlers.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But he felt down about his NFL chances when he was rarely mentioned among the nation’s best defensive prospects. Land wondered whether he needed to produce at an FBS school to get a look.</p><p>“I considered going into the portal, because even after I got 19 sacks and I was the No. 1 FCS player, I’d look for my name and I’m not even a top defensive player in the country,” Land said. “I’d look up top-100 players and I’m not even in there. That’s what really made me want to consider leaving and prove myself.”</p><p>But Land chose to return to Florida A&M, a decision he doesn’t regret. His 2022 statistics (23 tackles, eight sacks) weren’t as gaudy as they were in 2021, as opponents used multiple blockers to slow him down, but Land was still invited to the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine.</p><p>Part of Land’s loyalty to Florida A&M, and HBCUs in general, involves opportunity. He entered his senior year at Grayson High School in Loganville, Ga., with no scholarship offers. Florida A&M offered him a week before signing day. As he weighed whether to leave last year, Land remembered the Rattlers’ believing in him when other colleges didn’t.</p><p>“I felt like I was meant to be a Rattler,” he said.</p><p>Since the end of the 2022 season, Land has gained more than 20 pounds and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">impressed at the Senior Bowl</a>. He’s a low-risk, high-reward prospect because of his explosiveness in pass-rushing situations — despite physically looking more like a wide receiver than an edge rusher.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Isaiah Land coming off the edge in the senior bowl: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AwURlpyYj7</a></p><p>— Imagidadnation (@imagidadnation) <a href=#>March 17, 2023</a></p><p>Land said there’s no extra pressure as the top HBCU prospect. Playing in the Senior Bowl showed him that he was just as athletic as, if not more than, his peers who played in Power 5 conferences.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“If anything, I felt an extra chip on my shoulder when I lined up at the Senior Bowl or at the combine,” Land said, referring to being one of the only HBCU representatives.</p><p>As for HBCU football, Land is optimistic about its future. He’s hoping his experience not only leads to an NFL contract but also inspires other players to play at Florida A&M or another HBCU.</p><p>“I’d rather be a part of the change rather than the trend of guys going to big schools,” he said. “I’d rather be a part of that change of small-school guys getting drafted high, and they have to respect our level of ball.”</p><p>Land added: “Now, more people are paying attention to us.”</p><h2>Other 2023 NFL Draft HBCU prospects to watch</h2><h3><a class=ath_autolink data-id=oFI9LMe1oAgRFNhS href=#>Mark Evans II</a>, G, Arkansas-Pine Bluff</h3><p>6 feet 2, 303 pounds</p><p>Evans primarily played left tackle in college, but his size is more suited to play in the interior as a pro.
