Here's a sampling of the tales:</p><p>"I've been on a plane, on a 747 with him going to Tokyo out of Chicago, on No. 4 on Northwest. We drank every bottle of vodka on the plane."</p><p>"So I drive over the airport and I met him at the Delta Crown Lounge. By the time we sat down we had about 45 minutes before he had to walk to the next gate. He drank 108 12-ounce beers."</p><p>"Andre used to ask me to get him six bottles of Mateus wine and ice them down. He would drink those before we went to the ring and no one could tell."</p><p>"They decided that there was no shifting him. There's no shifting a 550-pound, 7-foot-4 giant, so they had a choice: either call the authorities, and they didn't want that kind of publicity, or wait for him to wake up, which was the wiser decision."</p><p>Looking for more jaw-dropping photos like these of André The Giant?
