Ciara and Wilson were upfront about their abstinence prior to marriage.</p><h2>What brought Russell Wilson and Ciara together?</h2><p>Ciara and Wilson first met at a Wisconsin basketball game on March 26, 2015. Wilson stated that they conversed throughout the night and he fell in love with the vocalist almost instantly. He claimed he knew Ciara was the one when they both ordered double cheeseburgers with only ketchup for late-night snacks.</p><p>In April 2015, they made their first public appearance at the White House Correspondents Dinner.</p><h2>What is Russell Wilson’s wealth?

Ciara responded that they could, but that they wanted more time before beginning life with another child.</p><h2>What did the quarterback say to Ciara?</h2><p>Wilson stated that during their first date, Ciara saw his worn wallet and warned him he was “losing with it.” He recalled his response: “I held my finger up and said, ‘First of all, you can never lose with me. Secondly, with this wallet, this indicates consistency. This is what you can expect from me. You will receive an individual who is consistent every day.'” He also emphasised that, like with humans, what’s on the inside (of the wallet!) is what matters.</p><p></p><h2>Russell Wilson shares a sweet video of his youngster yelling “Let’s Ride” after the Broncos’ Super Bowl victory.</h2><p>Russell Wilson, quarterback for the Denver Broncos, is famed for his “Let’s Ride” remark. During promotional shoots for the team, a video of the quarterback uttering his new catchphrase went viral. In fact, numerous NFL and college football players provided their own perspectives during promotional photographs.</p><p>Sunday night, following Wilson and the Broncos’ 11-10 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, there was yet another interpretation of the phrase “Let’s Ride.” This time, however, it came from one of Wilson’s smallest but most ardent fans: his two-year-old son, Win.</p><p>Wilson published a video of Win holding a football and telling Broncos fans, “Let’s Ride.” Wilson titled the video “That WINNING sensation!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That WINNING feeling! <a href=# rel=noopener>#LetsRide</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s3AYic8D04</a></p><p>— Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 26, 2022</a></p><p>It was the Broncos’ second consecutive victory.
