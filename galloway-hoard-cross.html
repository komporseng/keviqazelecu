Noticing a bit of silver protruding from the dirt in a Scottish field, he and two friends began to dig.

I went into shock, endorphins flooded my system and away I went stumbling towards my colleagues waving it in the air.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a> The Smithsonian, the ninth-century cross was made in Northumbria or what is now northern England and southern Scotland and features evangelist symbols as well as gold and black inlays. It was also found with a delicate metal cord wrapped around it.</p><p>After careful cleaning, the dirt-encrusted cross yielded engravings of one of the four Gospel writers of the New Testament on each arm: Matthew as a human, Mark as a lion, Luke as a calf, and John as an eagle.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-310302 alt="Cross During Conservation" width=800 height=901 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cross-during-conservation.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-310302 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Museums Scotland</span><span class=caption-body>The 1,000-year-old cross during its restoration.</span></p><p>The four Gospel writers, three of which were represented as animals, were decorated in black niello (or metallic alloy) and gold leaf. Remarkably, not a single soul had seen this cross since the ninth century. Experts believe it was purposefully buried with the rest of the relics and was once worn by a cleric or king.</p><p>Indeed, Dr. Martin Goldberg, Principal Curator of the Early Medieval and Viking collections, is fairly convinced that whoever owned this particular piece was a high-ranking member of society.</p><p>“You could almost imagine someone taking it off their neck and wrapping the chain around it to bury it in the ground,” he said. “It has that kind of personal touch. We imagine that a lot of ecclesiastical treasures were robbed from monasteries… This is one of the [survivors].”</p><p>“The pectoral cross…. is an outstanding example of the Anglo-Saxon goldsmith’s art,” added Leslie Webster, who formerly curated the British Museum’s Britain, Prehistory and Europe collection. “The discovery of this pendant cross… is of major importance for the study of early medieval goldsmiths’ work, and for our understanding of Viking and Anglo-Saxon interactions.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-310303 alt="Galloway Hoard" width=900 height=597 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/galloway-hoard.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-310303 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Museums Scotland</span><span class=caption-body>The Galloway Hoard, uncovered in 2014 and set to be displayed from February to May 2021.</span></p><p>Because of its intricate design, cleaning the relic was no easy task. In order not to damage the item as a whole, researchers needed to improvise. Conservators used a carved porcupine quill, which was “sharp enough to remove the dirt yet soft enough not to damage the metalwork.”</p><p>According to National Museums Scotland, the cross will soon go on public display in the “Galloway Hoard: Viking-Age Treasure” exhibit at the Edinburgh Museum from Feb. 21 to May 9, 2021. The exhibit will include other artifacts from the Galloway Hoard, such as silver bracelets, gold rings, pins, and more. But in the end, it’s the cross that remains perhaps the most tantalizing aspect of the exhibit.</p><p>“The cross is a wonderfully visual representation of the work we have been doing to reveal new details about the Galloway Hoard,” said Goldberg. “The conservation work lets us see this object clearly for the first time in over a thousand years, but it also reveals a whole new set of questions.”</p><p>After learning about the 1,000-year-old Anglo-Saxon cross that was restored to its former glory, read up on these <a href=#>32 Viking facts that reveal one of history’s most misunderstood civilizations</a>.
